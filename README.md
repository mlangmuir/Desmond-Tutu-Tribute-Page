# Desmond Tutu Tribute Page
A tribute page of the late Archbishop Desmond Tutu that includes a biography and links to his most inspirational speeches.

This was my very first coding project, which I did as part of the Responsive Web Design certificate on Free Code Camp. The page was built using pure HTML and CSS with added media queries for responsiveness.

The page is hosted at the following link: https://desmond-tutu-tribute-page.netlify.app/
